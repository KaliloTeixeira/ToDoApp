## Web Application of To Do Lists

This Web App was created as part of a Trainee process.

My desire was to build not a simple to do list, but a functional and very beautiful To do App. So, I got inspired by Trello design and used the colors of the ICMC Junior (company that passed me the challenge) to add the Visual Identity from the company in the app.
